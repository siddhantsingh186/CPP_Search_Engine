# CPP_Search_Engine
A mini search engine that maps the searched word to the most relevant URL link.

## About:

A Search Engine's fundamental function is to locate a specific "sentence and its related content" with a single click. It works by searching each word in the query and looking for the most relevant and related information available on the Internet among countless web pages. To achieve this, Search Engines utilize processes like Web crawling, Indexing, and Searching. Despite the complexity involved, the search process efficiently retrieves the desired information from the vast expanse of the Internet.

## Searching & Indexing Technique :

PageRank is a technique used by Google Search Engine to Rank the Website based on the number of incoming links to the website. Google Bot is used for Indexing the New Webpages and the process used is Crawling. 

### MINI SEARCH ENGINE:
The Linear Search Technique is employed for searching through text files containing over 100 elements. Each element is indexed and stored. When a search is initiated, it examines all the relevant words in each element (line) and provides the index when the maximum word match is found. If no match is discovered, the specific search is indexed and then appended to the text file.
